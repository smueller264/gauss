## General Information

I struggled with linear algebra in math class and also wanted to improve my python skills. So I thought I would combine the two make this little program to help me understand both things better. It is also my first time using numpy, which I always wanted to try out.

## Goals

- [ ] row echelon form
- [ ] reduces row echelon form
